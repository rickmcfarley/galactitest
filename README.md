galactitest
===========

This is my attempt at porting/recreating Galacticraft to/for Minetest. 

For those who don't know, Galacticraft is a very cool space travel mod for Minecraft. 
It has rockets that can be built, planets to explore, precious oxygen that needs to be stored and so much more!

That being said, Galactitest will not be nearly as cool and complicated as Galacticraft.
I do hope to encorporate planets, rocket, and an oxygen system similar to and inspired by Galacticraft.
